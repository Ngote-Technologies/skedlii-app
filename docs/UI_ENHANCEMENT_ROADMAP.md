## üì¶ Implementation Guidelines

### Development Workflow

1. Create feature branch: `ui-enhancement/phase-X-component-name`
2. Implement enhancements with backward compatibility
3. Test thoroughly across devices/browsers
4. Create pull request with before/after screenshots
5. Code review focusing on functionality preservation
6. Merge and monitor for issues

### Code Standards

- Use existing design tokens and CSS variables
- Maintain component API compatibility
- Add new props as optional with defaults
- Include TypeScript types for new features
- Follow existing naming conventions

### Design Tokens

```css
/* Enhanced color palette */
--primary-gradient: linear-gradient(
  135deg,
  var(--primary),
  var(--primary-foreground)
);
--shadow-elevated: 0 20px 25px -5px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1), 0 10px 10px -5px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.04);
--animation-duration: 200ms;
--animation-easing: cubic-bezier(0.4, 0, 0.2, 1);
```

## üéØ Getting Started

To begin Phase 1:

1. Review this roadmap
2. Set up development environment
3. Run existing tests to establish baseline
4. Begin with Phase 1.2 (Button Components)
5. Follow implementation guidelines
6. Use phase checklist for each component

This roadmap ensures systematic UI enhancement while maintaining the robust functionality you've built. Each phase builds upon the previous one, creating a cohesive and modern user experience.
